# Evaders Universal Adventure 

## Main Mechanics:
The main mechanic of our game “Evaders Universal Adventure” consists of an evader doll that advances through the level, running along a platform. The player is responsible for making the evader avoid a series of obstacles, in this case people who want to eliminate you, while passing through doors that add, subtract, divide or multiply the number of evaders. The player does this by moving the evader from side to side, left to right of the platform. The player continues dodging people until reaching the finish line, where the level ends to begin another level. If you collide with a person, the level is considered lost in case the number of enemies is greater than the number the player has and the player must restart it, causing them to try again and again until completing the level. Also, if through a calculation door the number of evaders reaches zero, the level is also terminated and lost.

## Level Progression:
Each level starts with a few obstacles, the combination of obstacles and the number of these will increase a little the closer you get to the goal. The game will have different obstacles, and the setting takes place in 4 different environments but in this release there is only one environment with several levels, if you want to play in another environment, you must export the following scene in Unity, these other environments are intended so that some develop in the same place, but with greater difficulty.
In addition to obstacles, evaders pass through doors that increase or decrease the number of evaders, through addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
