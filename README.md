# Evaders Universal Adventure Beta

## Main Mechanics:
The main mechanics of our game “Evaders Universal Adventure” consists of an evader doll that advances through the level, running across a platform. The player is responsible for making the evader dodge a series of obstacles, while passing by gates that add, subtract, divide or multiply the number of evaders. The player does this by moving the evader from one side to the other, left to right of the platform. The player continues dodging obstacles until reaching the finish line, where the level ends to begin another level.
If you collide with an obstacle, the level is considered lost and the player must restart it, causing the player to try again and again until they complete the level. In the same way, if through a calculation gate the number of evaders reaches zero, the level is also terminated and lost.

## Level Progression:
Each level starts with a few obstacles, the combination of obstacles and the number of these will increase a little the closer you get to the goal. The game will have different obstacles, and the setting will change every 2 or 3 levels, designed so that some are set in the same place, but with greater difficulty.
In addition to obstacles, evaders go through gates that increase or decrease the number of evaders, through addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. We plan to design 10 short levels following this idea of changing the setting. Some ideas we have are:
- A highway with vehicles as obstacles.
- A highway with hydrants as obstacles.
- A field or grassland with trees as obstacles.
- A meadow with animals as obstacles.
- Be in space with asteroids as obstacles.
